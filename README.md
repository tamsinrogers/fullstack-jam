Please familiarize yourself with any docs provided to you before continuing.

In this repo, you'll find 2 deployable services:
1. Backend - dockerized deployable that will spin up a Python backend with FastAPI, Postgres SQL DB and some seeded data.
2. Frontend - locally deployable app via Vite with TypeScript/React

Please refer to the individual READMEs in the respective repos to get started!

Enjoy :D
